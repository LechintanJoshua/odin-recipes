    <p>No two aglio e olio recipes are alike, but this one is pretty
    true to the classic method. The key is slowly toasting the garlic
    slices to a perfect golden brown in the olive oil. If it's too
    light, you don't get the full flavor and if it's too dark it gets bitter</p>

    <p>My advice? Do it perfectly!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>80-100g of spaghetti</li>
        <li>50-100ml of extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>2-3 cloves of garlic</li>
        <li>chilli flakes</li>
        <li>parsley</li>
        <li>lemon (optional)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to prepare:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Bring a pot of salted water to a boil and add the spaghetti</li>
        <li>While the pasta is cooking chop the garlic</li>
        <li>In a cold skillet, combine the chopped garlic with olive oil</li>
        <li>Cook over medium heat to slowly toast garlic until golden brown and take it of the heat</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the skillet and season it with chilli flakes and parsley (and lemon if you'd like)</li>
        <li>Add a bit of pasta water and continue to stir</li>
        <li>Serve, eat and enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
